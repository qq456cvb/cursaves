Cursor stores chats locally. Switch machines and they're gone. This tool saves your chats to a git repo (or S3 bucket) so you can restore them anywhere — or copy them between workspaces on the same machine.

## How It Works

### Terminology

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat**           | A conversation with the AI in Cursor                                                                                      |
| **Workspace**      | Cursor creates one for each directory (or `.code-workspace` file) you open. Chats belong to workspaces.                   |
| **Workspace hash** | The opaque directory name under `workspaceStorage/`; use with `-w` when number/path doesn't work (e.g. custom workspaces) |
| **Project ID**     | How cursaves groups snapshots - based on git remote URL or directory name                                                 |
| **Snapshot**       | An exported chat saved to `~/.cursaves/snapshots/<project-id>/`                                                           |

### Chat → Workspace → Project Mapping

**Cursor stores chats per workspace (per directory path):**

```
/Users/alice/repos/myapp     → Workspace A → [chat1, chat2, chat3]
/Users/bob/repos/myapp       → Workspace B → [chat4, chat5]
ssh://core/home/user/myapp   → Workspace C → [chat6, chat7]
```

Each workspace is a unique path. Even the same repo cloned to different locations creates separate workspaces with separate chats.

**cursaves groups snapshots by project identifier (git remote URL):**

```
All three workspaces above have the same git remote:
  git@github.com:user/myapp.git

So all their chats get saved to:
  ~/.cursaves/snapshots/github.com-user-myapp/
```

**On import, cursaves matches snapshots to local workspaces by path:**

```
Machine A exports chat from: /Users/alice/repos/myapp
Machine B imports chat into: /Users/bob/repos/myapp  (same project ID, different path)
  → Paths in chat metadata are rewritten automatically
```

This means you can sync chats for the same repo across different machines, even if the local paths differ.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally (once per machine)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Callum-Ward/cursaves.git

# Initialize with a git remote (once per machine)
cursaves init --remote git@github.com:you/my-cursaves.git

# Or with an S3 bucket
cursaves init --backend s3 --bucket my-cursor-saves
```

Then from any project directory:

```bash
# Automatic bidirectional sync (pull behind + push ahead)
cursaves sync

# Or manually:
cursaves push              # save and push to remote
cursaves pull              # pull and restore conversations
# Then restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the imported chats
```

For SSH remote projects (or custom workspaces), Cursor stores chats on your local machine. Use `-w` to target a workspace:

```bash
# See all workspaces (local, SSH remote, custom .code-workspace)
cursaves workspaces

# Push/pull a specific workspace by number, hash, or path substring
cursaves push -w 3
cursaves push -w 497e8ab0   # by hash (from the Hash column)
```

`push` checkpoints your conversations and pushes to the remote. `pull` fetches from the remote and imports into Cursor's database. `sync` does both automatically — pulling conversations where your local copy is behind, and pushing ones where your local copy is ahead. After importing, restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the conversations.

### Example

```
$ cursaves push

Checkpointing conversations for /Users/you/Projects/my-app...
  3 conversation(s) checkpointed
  Committed
  Pushing... done

Done. 3 conversation(s) saved and pushed.
```

```
$ cursaves list

Conversations for /Users/you/Projects/my-app

```

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), macOS, Linux, or Windows, Git (for git backend).

**Tested with:** Cursor 2.6–3.0 (supports both old and new chat storage formats)

### Install as a global CLI tool (recommended)

```bash
# Standard install (git backend only)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Callum-Ward/cursaves.git

# With S3 support
uv tool install "cursaves[s3] @ git+https://github.com/Callum-Ward/cursaves.git"
```

This puts `cursaves` on your PATH so you can run it from any directory. Run this on each machine you want to sync between.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your PATH, run `uv tool update-shell` or add it manually.

### Update

```bash
uv tool upgrade cursaves
```

### Alternative: clone and run locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Callum-Ward/cursaves.git
cd cursaves
uv sync
uv run cursaves <command>

# Or without uv:
python -m cursor_saves <command>
```

## Setup

`cursaves` stores conversation snapshots locally at `~/.cursaves/snapshots/`. To sync between machines, you configure a **backend** — either a git remote or an S3 bucket.

### Option A: Git backend (default)

1. Create a **private** repository on GitHub/GitLab (empty, no README).
2. Initialize on each machine:

```bash
cursaves init --remote git@github.com:you/cursaves-data.git
```

This creates `~/.cursaves/` with a git repo and the remote configured. If you only want local checkpoints (no syncing), run `cursaves init` without `--remote`.

### Option B: S3 backend

1. Create an S3 bucket (private).
2. Configure AWS credentials (`aws configure`, env vars, or IAM role).
3. Install with S3 support and initialize:

```bash
uv tool install "cursaves[s3] @ git+https://github.com/Callum-Ward/cursaves.git"
cursaves init --backend s3 --bucket my-cursor-saves --region us-east-1
```

S3 avoids git history overhead and works well for large snapshot sets. Authentication uses the standard AWS credential chain.

### Start syncing

```bash
# Automatic bidirectional sync (recommended)
cursaves sync

# Or manually:
cursaves push              # checkpoint + push
cursaves pull              # pull + import into Cursor's database
# Then restart Cursor to see the imported conversations
```

The `sync` command pulls conversations where your local copy is behind the remote, then pushes conversations where your local copy is ahead — fully automatic, no prompts.

## Commands

All commands default to the current working directory as the project path. Use `-w <selector>` to target a workspace by number, hash, or path substring (from `cursaves workspaces`), or `-p /path` to specify a path directly.

| **`push`**     | **Checkpoint + push to remote**                            | No                    |
| **`push -s`**  | **Interactively select which conversations to push**       | No                    |
| **`pull`**     | **Pull from remote + import snapshots**                    | Yes                   |
| `init`         | Initialize sync (git remote, S3 bucket, etc.)              | No                    |
| `workspaces`   | List all Cursor workspaces (local, SSH, custom) with hash  | No                    |
| `list`         | Show conversations for a project                           | No                    |
| `snapshots`    | List snapshot projects available in ~/.cursaves/           | No                    |
| `status`       | Compare local conversations vs snapshots                   | No                    |
| `repair`       | Restore missing agent blobs from snapshots                 | Yes                   |
| `delete`       | Delete cached snapshots (interactive, by ID, or all)       | No                    |
| `export <id>`  | Export one conversation to a snapshot                      | No                    |
| `checkpoint`   | Export all conversations (no push)                         | No                    |
| `import --all` | Import snapshots (no pull)                                 | Yes                   |
| `watch`        | Auto-checkpoint and sync in the background                 | No (reads only)       |
| `copy`         | Copy conversations between workspaces (same machine)       | Yes                   |
| `doctor`       | Audit chats: find orphaned/lost conversations, recover them | Yes (with `--recover`) |
| `migrate`      | Migrate old chats to Cursor 3.0 global index                | Yes                   |
| `purge`        | Delete chats from Cursor's DB to reclaim disk space          | Yes                   |

Most of the time you only need `sync`. Use `push -s` when you want to push specific conversations. Use `repair` if you get "Blob not found" errors after importing. Use `doctor` to find and recover orphaned chats. Use `migrate` after updating to Cursor 3.0 to make all old chats visible in the sidebar. Use `purge` to delete chats and reclaim disk space (requires Cursor to be closed). Use `delete` to clean up snapshots you no longer need.

### Auto-sync with `watch`

```bash
# Run in a terminal on each machine -- handles everything automatically
cursaves watch -p /path/to/your/project

# Options
cursaves watch --interval 30     # check every 30s (default: 60)
cursaves watch --no-git          # checkpoint only, no git push/pull
cursaves watch --verbose         # log every check, not just changes
```

The watch daemon polls for database changes, auto-checkpoints when conversations update, and commits + pushes to git. On the other end, it pulls and picks up new snapshots.

## How Cursor Stores Chat Data

Cursor stores conversations in two local SQLite databases, not as files you can easily copy:

- **Workspace DB** (`workspaceStorage/{id}/state.vscdb`): Links conversations to a workspace. In Cursor ≤2.6, this contains a chat list (`allComposers`). In Cursor 3.0+, this list is removed and replaced by a central index in the global DB.
- **Global DB** (`globalStorage/state.vscdb`): The actual conversation content -- one JSON blob per conversation, keyed by `composerData:{UUID}`. In Cursor 3.0+, also contains `composer.composerHeaders` -- a central index mapping every chat to its workspace.

> **Cursor 3.0 migration (April 2026):** Cursor 3.0 centralized the chat-workspace index from per-workspace DBs into the global DB. cursaves handles both formats transparently. See [docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md](docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md) for details.

Data locations:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`
- Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\`

Notably, **chat data is always stored on the machine running Cursor's UI**, even when connected to a remote host via SSH. This is why switching machines means losing your conversation context.

For more details, see [docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md](docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md).

## Cross-Platform Support

### Project identity

Projects are identified by their **git remote origin URL**, not the local directory name. This means:

- `~/Projects/bob` and `~/repos/alice` with the same `origin` are treated as the same project -- conversations sync between them.
- Two unrelated repos both named `myapp` won't collide, because their remotes differ.
- Non-git directories fall back to matching by directory name.

You can see what identity is being used with `cursaves status`.

### Path rewriting

When importing conversations on a different machine, absolute file paths in conversation metadata (e.g., which files were attached as context) are automatically rewritten to match the target project path. The actual conversation content -- your messages and AI responses -- is fully portable with no modification.

For example, a conversation started on macOS at `/Users/you/Projects/myapp` will have its file references rewritten to `/home/you/repos/myapp` when imported on a Linux machine.

## Restarting Cursor After Import

Cursor caches all conversation data in memory at startup and never watches its SQLite files for external changes. After `pull` or `import` writes new conversations to the database, **you must fully restart Cursor** (quit and reopen) to see the imported conversations.

Note: "Developer: Reload Window" is not sufficient -- it reloads the renderer but doesn't re-read the conversation database. A full application restart is required.

## Safety

- **Read operations** (`list`, `export`, `checkpoint`, `status`, `watch`) work on a temporary copy of the database. They never touch Cursor's files and are safe to run while Cursor is open.
- **Write operations** (`import`, `pull`) back up the target database before writing, and refuse to run while Cursor is detected as running. Use `--force` to override (not recommended).
- Snapshots are self-contained JSON -- even if import goes wrong, you always have the raw data and the backup.

## Privacy Warning

Snapshot files contain your **full conversation data**: your prompts, AI responses, file paths from your machine, your machine's hostname, and timestamps.

**Use a private repository** for the `~/.cursaves/` remote. Do not push conversation snapshots to a public repo.

## Typical Workflows

### Local projects

```bash
# On Machine A -- before switching:
cursaves sync       # pushes your ahead conversations

# On Machine B -- after switching:
cursaves sync       # pulls the latest, pushes anything ahead locally
# Then restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the imported conversations
```

### Copying chats between workspaces (same machine)

Cursor isolates chats per workspace. If you clone the same repo to a new directory, or open it from a different path, your previous chats won't be there. `cursaves` can copy them across:

```bash
# Export chats from the old workspace
cd /path/to/old/checkout
cursaves push

# Import into the new workspace
cd /path/to/new/checkout
cursaves pull
# Restart Cursor to see the imported chats
```

This also works with `-s` to selectively pick which conversations to copy, and with `-w` to target specific workspaces without `cd`-ing into them.

No remote repo is needed for this — `cursaves init` (without `--remote`) is enough for local-only use.

### SSH remote projects

When you connect to a remote server via Cursor's SSH feature, **chats are stored on your local machine**, not on the remote server. This means:

- `cursaves` must run **locally** (not on the remote server)
- SSH workspace paths like `/home/user/repos/myapp` don't exist on your local filesystem
- You can't just `cd` into them and run `cursaves push`

**Pushing from SSH workspaces:**

```bash
# Interactive selection (recommended)
cursaves push -s
#  → Shows all workspaces (local + SSH), lets you pick which chats to push

# Or by workspace number, hash, or path
cursaves workspaces          # List workspaces; note the #, Hash, or path
cursaves push -w 3           # By number
cursaves push -w 497e8ab0    # By hash (for custom workspaces)
```

**Pulling into SSH workspaces:**

```bash
# Interactive selection (recommended)
cursaves pull -s
#  → Shows available snapshots by project
#  → Auto-detects matching SSH workspaces
#  → Imports into the correct workspace

# Or by workspace number, hash, or path
cursaves workspaces          # List workspaces; note the #, Hash, or path
cursaves pull -w 3           # By number
cursaves pull -w 497e8ab0    # By hash
```

**Important:** Run these commands in a **local terminal**, not in Cursor's integrated terminal (which runs on the remote server).

**After importing:** Restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the chats in your SSH session.

### Custom workspaces (`.code-workspace`)

If you use a VS Code/Cursor custom workspace (e.g. `my-proj.code-workspace`), it may not appear in `cursaves workspaces` with a recognizable path. In that case:

1. Find the workspace hash: browse `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/` (macOS), `~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/` (Linux), or `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\` (Windows) and locate the directory containing your chats.
2. Use the hash as the workspace selector: `cursaves push -w <hash>` or `cursaves pull -w <hash>`.

`cursaves workspaces` now shows custom workspaces as `(workspace)` and includes a Hash column you can use.

### Automatic sync

```bash
# Run on each machine -- handles everything in the background:
cursaves watch -p /path/to/your/project
```

The daemon handles checkpoint + git push/pull automatically. When you switch machines, conversations are already synced.

## Architecture

```
~/.cursaves/                   # Local snapshot store
  snapshots/
    github.com-user-repo/      # Identified by git remote URL
      <composer-id>.json.gz    # Self-contained conversation snapshot
  .git/                        # Present when using git backend

~/.config/cursaves/           # macOS/Linux config directory
%APPDATA%\cursaves\          # Windows config directory
  config.json                  # Backend configuration (git, s3, etc.)
  sync_state.json              # Tracks handled diverged snapshots

~/.local/bin/cursaves          # Global CLI tool (installed via uv)

cursaves/                      # Source repo (this repo, public)
  cursor_saves/                # Python package
  docs/
  pyproject.toml
  LICENSE
```

The tool code (this repo) is separate from your conversation data (`~/.cursaves/`). Install the tool once, point it at a private remote (git or S3), and sync from any project directory.

## Contributing

**Version bumps are required on every commit.** Users install via `uv tool install git+...` and update with `uv tool upgrade cursaves`. The upgrade command compares version numbers -- if the version doesn't change, it won't pull new code even with new commits.

Bump the version in **both** files:

- `pyproject.toml` (`version = "X.Y.Z"`)
- `cursor_saves/__init__.py` (`__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`)

Use [semver](https://semver.org/): patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes.
